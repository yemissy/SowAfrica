# SowAfrica

## Project Scope
   ### A. What is SowAfrica: 
   SowAfrica is a social media platform to help small non-profit organizations(Community-based organizations) doing great work
   in their communities, but have to exposure or traction in well developed countries gain exposure and traction. Which would
   lead to increased funding, support and investment into their community. The platform also provides rooms for collaboration
   with each other. The national problem it solves is to put government in check.                                                This platform is a part of a bigger non-profit organization called “TechBethel”, whose mission is to introduce technology
   specifically in the     disadvantaged communities in developing countries. We do this by creating literacy centers and
   libraries in these communities for people at the grassroots level , and we focus on topics like human rights, political
   structure and government systems.
