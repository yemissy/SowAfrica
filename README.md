# SowAfrica

## Project Scope
   ### A. What is SowAfrica: 
   SowAfrica is a social media platform to help small non-profit organizations(Community-based organizations)that have no     	 exposure or traction in well developed countries, gain exposure and traction. This would lead to increased funding, support    and investment into their community. The platform also provides rooms for collaboration with each other. 
   This platform is a part of a bigger non-profit organization called “TechBethel”, whose mission is to introduce technology
   specifically in the disadvantaged communities in developing countries. We do this by creating modern literacy centers and
   libraries in these communities for people at the grassroots level, and we focus on topics like human rights, political
   structure and government systems.
